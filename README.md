# Mathematical Miracles in the Qur'an: A Measured Approach with Amin Lessan

This document summarizes and elaborates on the presentation and discussion from the video titled [*Mathematical Miracles in the Qur'an: A Measured Approach with Amin Lessan.*](https://youtu.be/QC3sDbVcAbw?si=NJdIz8fWc3nGmGrq) brought to you be our beloved Brother Paul Williams, Founder and Director of [Blogging Theology Academy](www.bloggingtheologyacademy.com). Paul Williams studied philosophy and theology at the University of London. He is a revert from Christianity to Islam. The presentation covers mathematical phenomena observed in the Qur'an and provides a critical, evidence-based perspective on the topic. Below is a comprehensive overview of the key points, insights, and methodologies discussed.

## Introduction

- **Presenter:** Amin Lessan, a fourth-year PhD student at University College London (UCL), specializing in AI-enabled healthcare with a focus on brain cancer treatment.
- **Purpose of the Presentation:** To explore the mathematical aspects of the Qur'an in a nuanced and measured manner, avoiding overreach and ensuring transparency.
- **Scope:** Highlights transparent analysis and reproducibility using programming and computational tools.

## Why Examine the Qur'an Mathematically?

1. **Diverse Domains of Miracles:**
   - The Qur'an exhibits remarkable features across linguistics, history, biology, astronomy, psychology, and more.
   - Mathematics is another domain where the Qur'an’s patterns can be examined.

2. **Compatibility with Divine Origin:**
   - Muslims believe the Qur'an is the word of God, who created mathematics and infused it into the natural world.
   - The Qur'an explicitly references numbers and mathematical concepts, inviting exploration from this perspective.

3. **Catering to Diverse Audiences:**
   - Different miracles resonate with different individuals. Mathematical phenomena may appeal to those with a penchant for logic and numbers.

## Caveats and Principles

- **Primary Purpose of the Qur'an:**
  - The Qur'an is primarily a book of divine guidance, not a book of mathematics or science.

- **Avoid Overreach:**
  - Some claims about mathematical miracles are exaggerated or unfounded.
  - It's essential to avoid projecting occult practices or unwarranted patterns onto the Qur'an.

- **Preservation of the Qur'an:**
  - The Qur'an is believed to be preserved in its original form. Altering or forcing patterns compromises its integrity.

## Examples of Mathematical Phenomena

### 1. **Significance of the Number 19**
   - Referenced explicitly in Surah Al-Muddathir (74:30): “Over it are nineteen [angels].”
   - Subsequent verse explains this number as a test for disbelievers and a means of strengthening believers.
   - Probability calculations illustrate the improbability of random occurrences aligning with such patterns (e.g., divisibility tests involving the number 19).

### 2. **Patterns in Chapter and Verse Numbers**
   - **Chapter-Verse Matrix:**
     - Adds chapter and verse numbers and evaluates their parity (even or odd).
     - The result: 57 even and 57 odd sums, a balance divisible by 19.
     - Altering even one verse disrupts this balance, highlighting the precision of the Qur'an's structure.

   - **Additional Connections:**
     - Examples include multiples of 19 found in chapter-verse configurations and their relevance to Qur'anic themes.

### 3. **Correlations and Word Pairing**
   - Instances of paired concepts in the Qur'an occur an equal number of times:
     - “Believers” and “Disbelievers” both appear 115 times.
     - “Paradise” and “Hell” also occur in balanced quantities.

### 4. **Historical Contexts and Scientific Insights**
   - **Oral Transmission and Preservation:**
     - The Qur'an’s primary transmission was oral. Its precise structure and numerical balance are particularly remarkable given this.
   - **Scientific Corroborations:**
     - Embryology: Descriptions in the Qur'an align with modern scientific findings, as noted by experts like Dr. Keith Moore.
     - Astronomy: Differentiation between the moon as a “reflector” and the sun as a “lamp” aligns with contemporary understanding.
   - **Historical Accuracy:**
     - Differentiated references to Egyptian rulers (e.g., “Pharaoh” vs. “King”) match historical periods.

## Methodology

1. **Transparency in Analysis:**
   - All examples presented were verified using programming and computational methods.
   - Tools like Python libraries (“P-Quran”) allow reproducibility of results.

2. **Mathematical Rigor:**
   - Focused on basic arithmetic operations, ensuring simplicity and clarity.
   - Avoided convoluted chains of calculations that could be misinterpreted or seen as contrived.

3. **Critical Evaluation of Claims:**
   - Addressed controversial claims, including exaggerated or forced patterns.
   - Emphasized maintaining intellectual honesty and avoiding confirmation bias.

## Notable Discussions

- **Misinterpretations and Risks:**
  - Examples of overreach include claims about specific numerical coincidences unrelated to the Qur’an’s textual integrity.

- **Applications in Modern Contexts:**
  - The precision of Qur'anic patterns echoes principles of data integrity used in modern computing (e.g., error-checking algorithms).

- **Skepticism and Intellectual Honesty:**
  - Encouraged viewers to critically evaluate patterns while remaining open to their potential significance.

## Resources and Further Reading

1. **Videos and Scholars:**
   - Dr. Shabir Ally’s channel *Let the Quran Speak* (analysis of number 19).
   - Blogging Theology’s interviews with Dr. Louay Fatoohi and others.

2. **Books:**
   - *The Divine Reality* by Hamza Tzortzis.
   - Relevant Qur'anic translations and commentaries (e.g., Oxford University Press edition).

3. **Software and Tools:**
   - Python libraries for Qur’anic analysis (e.g., “P-Quran”).

## Conclusion

The mathematical phenomena in the Qur'an provide an additional layer of its miraculous nature, appealing to individuals with a logical or numerical inclination. While these patterns are remarkable, they should be approached with caution and humility to preserve the Qur'an’s integrity and primary purpose as divine guidance.
